Almost all examples are in the correct language, 1 example is the first part in Russian and the second in Ukrainian. 

Lots of commercial ads, some contain more running texts (e.g. descriptions of hotels), some less (e.g. sound equipment).

Occasionally the first part contains traces of menus, while the second part consists of running text.

Porn:
* Mostly porn-free, only a couple of porny texts ("narrative/descriptive" porn, not just lists of porn hashtags)

Unnatural language:
* Alghough I didn't mark it as unnatural, I noticed many texts that are "cut", this is, ok text starts, then is cut with "read more", more unrelated ok texts follows, ends with "read more", etc. I think those are lists of headlines or blog posts titles.
* Some menus or breadcrumb menus.

Identified language: 
* All the samples are in the correct language (Spanish)

Other:
* In general, the content is varied (some advertising, some newspaper text, some forum threads, ...)
* Some glued words here and there. 
* Some "mixed content", this is, actual text with pieces of boilerplate inserted (i.e. 578d4b4056ba8794ede85d07dc1b1d7d or 3ff3eb1a9f4edefa9c649e928ee2671f)
* More PII than I expected, mainly phone numbers and email adresses.

# Ona,  [cat_Latn/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/cat_Latn/batch0.tsv)
Porn:
No porn found at all.

Unnatural language:
* There are some wikipedia pages with "modify" or "edit code"
* Some lists of services from hotels.

Identified language: 
* All the samples are in the correct language, except three that contain a sentence or two in English.

Other:
* In general, the content is varied (some advertising, some newspaper text, some forum threads with slang language, hotel advertisments, wikipedia pages, also some bureaucratic documents...)
* Some glued words here and there.

From e-mail: 
1) Sometimes there seem to be some sentence boundaries issues, like missing punctuation signs. I have not annotated this in any special way, just for you to know.

2) Also, some samples look from Wikipedia and have the regular tags "modify, edit" and so on. I have marked it as unnatural language. For example:

    . Referències[modifica | modifica el codi] - ↑ Transport for London. «Sobre London River Services (anglès)». [Consulta: 2008-04-01]. - ↑ ThamesClippers:

3) There are quite a bit of texts from hotels, listing services and so on. It is not "natural" language per se, as they are lists. How should I tag them?

    The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel New York, U.S.A.. Disponibilitat Instal·lacions General - Aparcament - Restaurant - Animals admesos - Bar - Recepció 24 hores - Premsa - Habitacions per a no fumadors - Adaptat per a persones de mobilitat reduïda - Ascensor - Caixa forta - Servei d'aparcador de cotxes - Calefacció - Guardaequipatges - Botigues - Zones comunes i privades per a no fumadors - Aire condicionat - Registre d'entrada/sortida exprés - Habitacions aptes per a al·lèrgics - Snack-bar - On-site

4) Finally, some samples only had the beginning of the text, not two slices of text. I mean without the ".........." in the middle. I hope that's allright and something is not missing.

Porn: 
* No porn at all.

Unnatural language:
* A lot of Wikipedia boilerplate. I didn't mark as unnatural when only one or two "edit source" are in the text, but I marked texts as unnatural when too many "edit source" are present.

Identified language:
* Only about half of the examples are in the correct language (Asturian). The rest are either in Spanish, or other Spanish minority languages (Extremeño, Aragonese, ...) that are quite similar to Asturian.
* A lot of random list of contents for SEO (i.e. songs names) that are not even in Asturian.

Other:
* Batch is mostly Wikipedia. Maybe we want to enhance the wikipedia boilerplate removal (see "unnatural language" above).
* All the non-Asturian documents came from Wikipedia (either ext, Extremeño, or an, Aragonese). These could be easily filtered out if we discard Wikipedia documents from  other languages that are not the target language (ast, Asturian, in this case).

# Sampo,  [fin_Latn/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/fin_Latn/batch0.tsv)

* Porn: 2/200, one SEO spam and one terms of service -style text for a porn site.
* Unnatural: 9/200, mostly poorly machine-translated or generated Finnish, one instance of moslty tabular data.
* Language: 100% Finnish.

Miscellaneous notes:

* Several Wikipedia pages, most including insertions such as "[Edit WikiText]". I did not mark these as unnatural despite the insertions breaking the flow. It might be possible to do better here by extracting Wikipedia pages from dumps with a custom tool.
* Several instances of text where the latter part was a list of links, in cases consisting of fragments interrupted by e.g. "... [read more]". I did not mark these as unnatural. Cleanup would require some form of line-level filtering.

# Proyag Pal,  [ben_Beng/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/ben_Beng/batch0.tsv)
"Didn't mark anything unnatural because none of them were mostly unnatural text, but there are many examples with dates and times interspersed with the text, probably from comments sections. Also a lot of lines have a header line (news headline or Wikipedia title) at the beginning continuing into the main text without any punctuation or delimiter."


# Petter,  [nob_Latn/batch1.tsv](../annot_round1/nob_Latn/batch1.tsv) and also [nno_Latn/batch0.tsv](../annot_round1/nno_Latn/batch0.tsv)
Bokmål: Some pornography, 4/200, but also some sexually explicit material potentially related to commercials or discussions of sexual health.

Quite a few of the unnatural-sounding texts are clear translations from various websites, such as travel-related sites.

Some texts contain dialectal material which is not really Bokmål, but also not unnatural, and would not fit anywhere else either. 

Similar to Finnish, there are many Wikipedia pages with similar insertions. I have not marked texts as unnatural as long as the language contained is in fact natural, even if there were some headers and lists, or wiki-related insertions. This is the same for Nynorsk.

Nynorsk is also otherwise similar, containing some dialectal data, but no non-pornographic sexual material was identified.
